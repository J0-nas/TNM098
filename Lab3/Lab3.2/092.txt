 and so arthurjean i concluded my guess is that for some crazy reason it s up to me to take up where winnie left off and try to do a good job with the hand he s dealt himself
 she remained silent hunched on the floor beside me with her maroon pyjamas straining visibly and a pile of cigarette butts in the ash tray at her side
 give me a break i pleaded
 when i tried to tell my wife winnie s wife mrs
 tompkins that is all she could think of was to send me off to a plush lined booby hatch until i was sane again
 the others at least virginia rutherford are beginning to suspect that something is wrong and that damned dog knows it
 so be original and pretend that i might be telling the truth
 she didn t answer
 instead she stood up stretched strolled over to the kitchenette and mixed us both two good stiff drinks
 mud in your eye she said
 glad to see you on board i don t see why not she observed conversationally
 i don t pretend to be smart and i know that the other girls in the office think i m nothing but a tramp because i don t pretend i don t like men but i m damned if i think that winnie who is one of god s sweetest dumb bells could have dreamed up anything as screwy as this
 as i remember him he wasn t any too bright i said
 skip it he wasn t dumb in business
 he picked up a couple of million bucks and gave them a good home in his safe deposit box
 he wasn t so hot on music and books and art except for his damned ducks but he was a lot of fun
 he liked a good time and he liked a girl to have a good time
 he should have been born in one of those latin countries where the women do all the work and the men play guitars drink and make love
 i drew a deep breath
 i had won my first convert
 i knew what paul of tarsus felt when he met up with timothy
 i thought of mahomet and fatima karl marx and bakunin hitler and hess
 crazy though the whole world would consider me here was one human being who could listen to my story without phoning for an ambulance
 tell me about this frank jacklin arthurjean remarked
 i don t get all the angles about him and this dorothy
 seems to me you winnie that is told me he was the guy she d had a sort of crush on at school
 winnie was still sort of sore about it twenty years later
 it s hard for me to be fair i admitted
 jacklin was a big shot at school and may have had a swelled head
 winnie wasn t so hot then nice but with too much money
 jacklin s people were poor by comparison that is
 he got through yale slid out into the newspaper game held his job married a girl had a bust up with his wife and joined the navy as a reserve officer after she walked out on him
 the navy assigned him to p
 work and sent him to the pacific
 he sounds like a heel she observed leaving his wife like that
 tell me more about her
 is she pretty i thought a long time
 i don t quite know i said finally
 i never knew
 she was necessary to me long after i was necessary to her
 she had a mole on her left hip and a gruff way of talking when she was really fond of me
 i guess she got tired of living in hartford and took it out on me
 any kids i shook my head vigorously
 cost too much on a newspaper salary
 she said she didn t want any until we could afford them
 i was fool enough to believe her
 then when we could afford them she didn t want them
 can t say i blame her
 did she make you happy of course not who wants to be happy she made me miserable but it was exciting to be around her
 i never knew what i d find when i got home a knockdown drag out fight over nothing at all or hearts and flowers equally over nothing
 arthurjean yawned
 that part s convincing she agreed
 i ll play this one straight
 you re frank jacklin and winnie tompkins rolled into one
 the point is where do we go from here let s see you sign jacklin s name
 i pulled out winnie s gold life time fountain pen and wrote frank e
 jacklin over and over again on the back of an envelope
 she studied it carefully
 that s no phony she agreed and it s nothing like winnie s handwriting
 think i could get a check cashed on it let s try i suggested
 tomorrow when i get to the office i ll pre date a check on the riggs bank at washington
 you mail it in for collection and we ll see if it clears
 she shook her head
 no dice if i tried that first thing we know we d have the a
 dicks after you for forgery
 can you think of anything else not unless you go to washington and see dorothy in o
 and ask her to verify my handwriting
 or wait
 you can go and talk to her and notice whether she wriggles her nose to keep her spectacles up
 you can find out whether she s still nuts about prokofiev
 you can ask if she still thinks that ernest hemingway is a worse writer than charles dickens and whether she still uses chanel s gardenia perfume
 that s enough she interrupted
 but how m i going to get to washington and do all these things next week i said you and i can fly down on a business trip war contracts cut backs something official and while i m being whip sawed by the desk heroes you can check on dorothy
 see if i m not right
 she nodded
 that s one way
 what can we cook up the office is tied up in estate work and that leaves no chance for uncle sam
 you get what he leaves the heirs and they tell me that the inheritance tax is here to stay
 i considered the problem
 tell you what arthurjean i replied
 i ve been thinking this over
 the war s going to end this summer
 what i saw on the alaska means that nobody can hold out against us
 the germans are on their last legs but most of the wise guys are saying that it will take from eighteen months to two years to clean up japan a million casualties billions of dollars
 this thorium bomb will do the trick and the war will be over by labor day
 there s a chance for winnie tompkins to make another two or three millions
 she laughed sardonically
 how there s uranium stocks i suggested
 all sewed up by the insiders
 last year you or winnie got a query on uranium and found that there wasn t any to be had
 there s wheat and sugar i argued
 the world s going to be hungry
 there s a famine coming sure as hell
 buy futures and we ll be set
 sure she agreed if you want to buy black and can get funds into cuba or the argentine
 but there are inter allied pools operating in sugar and wheat and you can t break into the game without connections at washington
 how about peace babies i demanded
 we can sell our war bonds and invest in something solid for post war reconstruction
 say general motors or u
 arthurjean crossed the room and rumpled my head affectionately
 baby she observed it s damn lucky for you and winnie s dough i know my way around the street
 lay off heavy industrials until the labor business gets straightened out
 it s all set for a big strike wave when the shooting stops and a lot of investors are going to be burned
 you can sell short of course but you ll have to wait for that
 if you must go in for gambling try the race track or the slot machines
 uncle sam has it fixed so that the only way you can make money out of the peace is to be a swiss or a swede
 but that doesn t make sense i objected
 in any place and at any time advance knowledge on what is going to happen is worth a fortune
 how about selling some of the war industries short she shook her head
 you wait till you ve been to washington
 some of the smart guys down there may know the answers
 perhaps it will be real estate if they can only get rid of rent control
 probably it will be surplus war stocks but that s going to be a political racket
 anyhow the tax collector will be waiting for you so why worry speaking of cashing checks i reminded her how in hell am i going to get some dough how does winnie sign himself at the city farmers anyhow she laughed
 he has three or four separate accounts
 the one he uses for purely personal hell raising is just signed w
 let s see you try to write that
 remember he loops all his letters and draws a little circle instead of a dot over the i 
 i tried that a few times until she shook her head
 there isn t a bank clerk in new york who wouldn t stop a check with that on it
 let s see he signed his name to something around here
 see if you can t copy it
 she fumbled under a pile of magazines and finally came up with a copy of the story of philosophy by will durant
 winnie thought this would be good for me she explained
 here it is for miss arthurjean briggs with the compliments of w
 he was like that sort of formal it gave him a kick
 he bought that for me second hand after we d been drinking atlantic city dry at an investment bankers convention
 try it
 i tried the signature again but the effort was even worse than my free hand efforts
 this time it looked like what it was a clumsy forgery
 hell i exclaimed i ve simply got to do better than that
 how about my tracing it you d be surprised she told me how easy it is to spot a signature that s been traced
 it s something about the flow of the ink and the angle of the pen
 no two signatures are exactly alike and that s why a tracing gives itself away
 they got machines which spot it
 well how m i going to get some dough i demanded
 i can t draw on jacklin s washington account and the chances are there isn t much there anyhow
 and if i try to draw on tompkins account i ll find myself in the hoosegow
 she got up and mixed us another pair of drinks
 i got it she announced
 it won t be too nice for you but it s better than starving
 you mean you ll lend me some hell baby i got no money twenty five or thirty in the account and a few hundreds in war bonds
 no this is better
 just hold out your hand and shut your eyes
 it sounded like jewels
 i leaned back in the chair closed my eyes and extended my right hand in front of me palm upward
 i heard her pad into the bathroom
 when she came back her voice sounded strained as she whispered this is it baby
 keep those eyes shut there was a smooth tingling sensation across the tips of my fingers then my right hand was suddenly warm and wet
 i opened my eyes to see arthurjean holding a stained safety razor blade in her hand and staring at me white faced as the blood trickled from my finger tips
 winnie she faltered and slumped down in the divan
 i hastily grabbed the handkerchief from my breast pocket and wrapped it around my throbbing fingers
 ouch damn you i exclaimed
 i m sorry baby she whispered
 i didn t want to hurt you
 it seemed the only way you damned fool i almost shouted at her
 do you realize you flopped with that blade in your hand and might have cut an artery no did i she scrambled up hastily and looked around
 gee i feel lousy
 does it hurt much not yet
 what s the big idea now you sound like winnie she replied
 he never got ideas easy
 listen you big slob if you ve cut your fingers you got to have a bandage and if you got a bandage on your right hand your signature s going to be screwy
 all you need do is fumble it and i or one of the girls will witness it and the bank will clear it and you ll get the dough
 i thought that one over
 you ve got something in your head besides those big blue eyes i admitted
 now if you only have some iodine and bandages we ll see if i can stave off lock jaw
 she giggled
 lock jaw s the last thing you ll get she said
 there ought to be something in the medicine cabinet
 gee she added
 i suppose i ll have to get you undressed and dress you in the morning just like a baby
 ain t that something how about some food i demanded
 you said something about a steak back at the office and all you ve given me is scotch and razor blades
 you get on with your cooking and let me try to fix my hand
 i went into the bathroom located some mercurochrome and a box of band aids
 once the flow of blood had slacked i managed to incapacitate myself sufficiently for the purpose of forging winnie tompkins signature
 say winnie arthurjean suddenly appeared at the bathroom door with an aroma of steak behind her
 i ve just figured out something
 if you aren t winnie but a ringer from the aleutians it s not decent for you to see me in my pyjamas
 we re strangers oh keep em on till after dinner i said
 i won t stand on ceremony
 i m hungry
 she laughed
 you sure can make like winnie she admired
 jesus the steak s burning
