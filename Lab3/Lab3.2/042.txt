tompkins wasson cone maintained sincere looking offices on one of the upper floors of no
 1 wall street
 the rooms were carefully furnished in dark wood and turkey red upholstery in a style calculated to reassure elderly ladies of great wealth that the firm was careful and conservative
 the girl at the reception desk looked as though she had graduated with honor from wellesley in the class of 1920 and still had it pince nez and condescension but she was thoroughly up to date in her office technique
 oh mr
 tompkins she murmured in a clear low voice there s a gentleman waiting to see you in the customer s room a mr
 he s been here since ten o clock this morning
 he s had no lunch i inquired
 she shook her head
 i clucked my tongue
 we can t have our customers starve to death can we send out for a club sandwich and some hot coffee
 give me five minutes to take a look at my mail and then send him in
 when the food arrives send that in too
 i clean forgot
 she blinked her hazel eyes behind her pince nez to show that she understood and i walked confidently down to the end of the corridor to where a mr
 tompkins stared at me conservatively from a glazed door
 my office lived up to my fondest dream of winnie
 it was an ingenious blend of the 1870 s and functional furniture like a cocktail of port wine and vodka
 there were electric clocks a silenced stock ticker in a glass covered mahogany coffin an elaborate sheraton radio with short wave reception tuned in on wqxr and desks and chairs and divans and a really good steel engraving showing general grant receiving lee s surrender at appomattox court house with a chart underneath to explain who was who in the picture
 the desk i was glad to note was bare except for an electric clock calendar which told me that it was 3 12 p
 of april 4 1945 and a handsome combination humidor cigarette case and automatic lighter in aluminum and synthetic tortoise shell
 a glance out the window gave me a reassuring glimpse of the spire of trinity church
 there was a single typed memo on the glass top of the desk which read mr
 harcourt 10 13 a
 would not state business
 will wait
 i pushed one of the array of buttons concealed underneath the edge of the desk and a door opened to admit a largish blonde in a tight fitting sweater
 yes mr
 tompkins please have mr
 harcourt sent in i said and when he comes bring your notebook and take a stenographic record of our conversation and er what s your name she raised her well plucked eyebrows
 i m eleanor roosevelt my parents named me arthurjean after both of them arthurjean miss briggs to you very well miss briggs tell mr
 harcourt i ll see him now
 a moment later she reappeared holding a card in her fingers as though it was a live cockroach
 sure you want to see this she asked
 the card read mr
 harcourt special agent
 federal bureau of investigation u
 department of justice u
 court house foley square new york 23 n
 of course i replied i ve been expecting him for some time
 harcourt was neat but not gaudy a clean cut hart shaffner and marx tailored man of about thirty five with that indefinable family resemblance to j
 edgar hoover which always worries me about the f
 good afternoon mr
 harcourt i said pleasantly and what can i do for the f
 harcourt shook my hand took a seat refused a cigarette and cast a doubtful glance over his shoulder at arthurjean briggs who was working semi silently away at a stenotype machine
 oh that s my secretary i explained
 i always have her take a record of important conversations in this office
 i hope the machine doesn t disturb you mr
 if it s all right with you it s all right with me he said grudgingly
 i thought perhaps you d rather have this private
 not in the least i replied
 miss briggs is the soul of discretion and i can imagine nothing we could talk about that i wouldn t want her to hear
 the g man looked as though he was worrying over whether he ought to call washington for permission
 they hadn t taught him this one in the f
 academy of finger printing marksmanship shadowing and wire tapping
 by the way mr
 harcourt i added i just learned as i came in that you ve been waiting for me since ten this morning
 it s after three now so i took the liberty of sending out for a sandwich and some coffee for you
 i thought you might like a bite of lunch while you are talking with me
 the special agent looked as surprised as though he had found hoover s fingerprints on the murder gun but he nodded gamely
 here it is now i remarked as there was a knock on the door and a knowing looking boy placed an appealing tray load of sandwiches pickles and coffee in front of mr
 now you go right ahead and eat your lunch i urged
 ask me for any information in my possession and you shall have it
 and of course i ll have miss briggs send a complete transcript of our talk to you at f
 headquarters by registered mail
 first of all if you don t mind would you show me your official identification and let miss briggs take down the number and so on
 it s always best to put these things in the record isn t it the g man gulped and produced a battered identity card complete with fingerprints number hoover s signature and a photograph which would have justified his immediate arrest on suspicion of bank robbery
 i imagine mr
 harcourt i remarked that you ve had plenty of time in the last five hours to question members of my staff about whatever it is you think they might know about my business
 he looked up almost pathetically
 i asked a few questions he admitted
 this is just an informal inquiry
 nothing for grand jury action yet
 i didn t like that last word
 do you think i ought to call my lawyer in before i proceed with our talk i asked
 i resent your reference to grand jury action
 so far i don t even know what you wish to see me about and you have just made a libelous statement in front of a reliable witness
 is that the way j
 edgar hoover trains his gestapo i well come on harcourt let s get on with it i interrupted
 i m a busy man and you ve wasted five hours of the time my taxes help to pay for just waiting to take more of my time
 he pulled a black leather notebook out of his pocket and consulted it
 the bureau was asked to interrogate you mr
 tompkins on behalf of another government agency
 which internal revenue w
 the s
c no sir it was none of those
 i m not at liberty to tell you which one
 i am simply instructed to ask you what you know about u
 alaska and naval dispositions in the north pacific
 i leaned back and laughed
 now i get it i said
 that s o
i and that triple plated ass ranty tolan trying to win the war in the barrooms of new york
 it all goes back to a dream i had while i was dozing at the pond club monday afternoon
 something about the u
 alaska being blown up off the aleutians
 tolan was there when i woke up and i passed a few remarks about my dream before i was fully awake if you know what i mean
 that s all there is to it mr
 the special agent made a number of hen tracks in his notebook
 thank you very much mr
 tompkins he said
 no doubt you ll be able to explain things if my chief wants to call you in
 i don t think my chief believes in dreams
 not that kind of dream
 not in war time
 i laughed again
 i m afraid i can t help that
 so far as i am concerned the f
 can believe in my dream or stick it in the files
 harcourt coughed
 it s not easy working with o
i or other intelligence outfits he said
 they never tell us anything
 the trouble with your dream seems to be that the general public isn t supposed to know that the u
 alaska is in commission and that the navy department has had no word from her since last saturday
 don t let that worry you i said
 if she was anywhere near the kuriles she d keep radio silence specially off paramushiro
 oh harcourt remarked
 didn t say anything about paramushiro
 thank you mr
 we ll be in touch with you off and on
 he rose very politely shook hands again thanked me for the food nodded to miss briggs and made a definitely grade a exit
 his steps died away down the corridor
 miss briggs waited until he was out of earshot then turned to me
 you god damned fool she said fondly
 you had him bluffed until you talked about paramushiro
 why did you admit anything i looked up at her broad pleasant face
 so you ve made a monkey out of me
 i alibied you up and down
 listen winnie the f
 have been all over the joint since early yesterday
 we were warned not to whisper a word to you
 there was an agent waiting to grill me when i got home last night
 i told him you d been spending the week end with me
 you told him i was startled
 sure why not he wasn t interested in my morals
 i told him about our place up in the fifties and gave you a complete alibi from friday close of business until monday noon
 and now you have to make like a nazi with the ships in the pacific
 say what is it you ve supposed to have done kissed macarthur damned if i know miss briggs
 that s part of the trouble
 lay off that miss briggs stuff
 that was to punish you for giving me the fish eye when you came in
 i m your arthurjean and the market s closed so you d better catch the subway uptown with me and i ll cook you a steak dinner at our place
 this was too deep water for hesitation so i took the plunge
 taking my hat and coat i told the genteel receptionist that i d be back in the morning
 i waited for arthurjean at the foot of the elevators and followed her lead into the east side subway and up to the 51st street station on to our place
 it was very discreet an old brown stone front converted into small apartments
 there was no door man and an automatic elevator prevented any intrusive check on the comings and goings of the tenants
 the third floor front had been made into a pleasant little two room suite a master s bedroom why not mistress s i thought with a double bed dresser and chairs and an array of ducks which revealed the true tompkins touch
 there was a small sitting dining room as well and a kitchenette with a satisfactory array of bottles in the frigidaire and a reasonable amount of groceries
 arthurjean took off her hat and coat fixed me a good stiff drink and then disappeared into the bathroom
 after a good deal of splashing and gurgling she reappeared clad in maroon satin pyjamas
 there she said now i feel better
 i smiled at her
 here s to arthurjean i said
 nuts to arthurjean she replied
 how about winnie you ve always been swell to me and you know it
 i don t care if you re a louse or a souse
 you can always come to me any time you re in trouble and i ll fix you up
 now you re in trouble with the cops so how about me helping you huh you re a good kid i said truthfully for arthurjean was indeed one of god s own sweet tarts
 the truth is i m in all kinds of a jam
 you see i can t seem to remember what i ve been doing before last monday
 it s sort of like loss of memory only worse
 this f
 thing is only one of my headaches
 she looked at me questioningly
 so you don t remember where you were before monday she asked
 she slouched across the room leaned down and gave me a hearty kiss
 will that help you remember it was like i told that detective
 you and me were right here in this place over easter and don t forget it
 i sighed
 i liked arthurjean though she was as corned beef and cabbage to germaine s caviar and champagne
 okay i said
 i won t forget it
 attaboy she agreed
 now that we ve got that settled suppose you tell me where the hell you really were over the week end
 you stood me up friday night and today s the first time i ve set eyes on you since you left the office friday morning
 boy you may have some explaining to do to the f
 but it s nothing to what you got to explain to momma
