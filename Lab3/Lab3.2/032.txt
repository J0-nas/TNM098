a pretty dark haired maid opened the door of pook s hill with a twitch of the hip that was wasted on bedford hills
 oh it s you she remarked conversationally
 shall i tell mrs
 tompkins you are here and why not i asked
 she looked at me slant eyed
 why not sir she must have forgotten to eat an apple this morning
 that s why
 where shall i dump my hat and coat mary i asked guessing wildly at her name
 suburban maids were named mary as often as not
 the name is myrtle mr
 tompkins she replied and did not bother to add the as well you know she implied
 from now on myrtle you shall be mary so far as i am concerned
 and where mary shall i leave my hat and coat in the den sir of course
 come i ll lend a hand
 you ve been drinking again
 the girl moved quite close to me in helping me off with my things and it was only by a distinct effort of will that i refrained from giving that provocative hip the tweak it so openly invited
 this way mr
 tompkins she said sarcastically so i rewarded her with a half hearted smack which brought the requisite oh you never can tell when you will need a friend below stairs and it was obvious that winnie the dog had been trifling with her young buttocks if not her affections
 that sort of thing must stop if i was going to get anywhere in my run through the maze
 too abrupt a change in the manners and morals of winfred tompkins however might arouse suspicion
 any news today mary i asked
 nothing sir
 the kennels telephoned to say that ponto had made a miraculous recovery and could come home tomorrow
 i had them send word to the club to tell you
 and mrs
 tompkins as i said forgot to eat her apple
 i looked at her
 this was a cue
 i mustn t miss it
 and the doctor didn t keep away i asked
 him i should say not mrs
 tompkins felt quite unsettled right after lunch and phoned dr
 rutherford to come over
 he s with her now upstairs giving her an examination
 she rolled her eyes significantly in the direction of the second story
 wait a few minutes till i catch my breath and get my bearings mary i said and then tell mrs
 tompkins most discreetly if you know what i mean that i have returned and am waiting in my i waved vaguely at the room
 in your den sir she agreed
 the name is myrtle
 the den was one of those things i have never attained perhaps because i never wanted to
 there was a field stone fireplace over which the antlered head of a small stag presided with four upturned feet like a calf in a butcher shop that held two well dusted shotguns
 the walls were lined with books up to a dado books in sets with red morocco and gilt bindings dickens thackeray surtees robert louis stevenson dumas balzac and similar standard authors all highly respectable and mostly unread
 on the table beside a humidor and cigarette cases was a formidable array of unused pipes
 above the shelves the walls were adorned with etchings of ducks ducks sitting ducks swimming ducks nesting ducks flying and ducks hanging dead
 it was as though winnie s conscience or attorney had advised him you can t go wrong on ducks old boy instead he had gone wild
 in one corner of the den my unregenerate navy eye discerned a small portable bar with gleaming glasses decanters and syphons
 further investigation was rewarded by the makings of a very fair scotch and soda
 to my annoyance the cigarette box contained only de luxe benson hedges it would while i am a sucker for tareytons
 still any cigarette is better than no cigarette
 a little mooching around the fireplace revealed the switch which turned on an electric fire ingeniously contrived to represent an expensive manhattan architect s idea of smouldering peat
 the whole effect was very cosy in the town and country sense a gentleman s gun room and i had settled down most comfortably on the broad leather divan in front of this synthetic blaze when i was interrupted by an angry tenor voice
 i say tompkins soared the voice
 i thought we had agreed to be civilized about this thing
 i raised my head to see a lean dark haired dapper little man with a dinky little british raj mustache and a faint odor of antiseptics glaring at me from the doorway
 rutherford i presume i remarked
 yes winnie came a pleasant but irritated womanly voice from somewhere behind the doctor and i too would like to know what this means
 is that you jimmie i guessed
 of course it s me who else did you expect one of those flashy blondes from your office sh shushed the doctor reprovingly
 what about virginia what have you done with her this required serious thought
 the glass of scotch was a good alibi for amnesia
 to whom do you refer i asked putting a slight thickness into my voice
 to virginia my wife he snapped
 we agreed it was understood between the four of us i shook my head virtuously
 i haven t set eyes on her all day i said
 i don t know where she is and i refuse to be held responsible for her in any particular
 she s your look out not mine
 why you the doctor started forward menacing me with his surgical little fists
 wait a minute jerry the contralto voice ordered
 let me handle this germaine tompkins stepped forward into the room and stood in the flickering light of the electric peat
 tell me winnie she asked has anything gone wrong my wife was a tall slim girl with dark eyes dark hair parted sleekly in the 1860 style and a cool slender neck
 she was wearing something low cut in black velvet with a white cameo brooch at the v of a bodice which suggested a potentially undemure quakeress
 i noticed that she had angry eyes a sulky mouth and a puzzled expression
 i m sorry jimmie i replied after a good look at her but i have decided that i simply couldn t go through with it
 do you mean to say dr
 rutherford began only to be hushed by germaine
 let me handle him jerry she whispered
 you d better go
 he s tight
 i ll phone you in the morning
 all right if you say so dear the doctor obeyed
 and be sure to send me a bill for this call i added
 professional services and what not
 and don t come back to my house without my personal invitation
 rutherford emitted a muttered comment and disappeared into the gloom of the hall
 my wife followed him and i could hear a series of confused and comforting whispers sending him on his way
 i had finished my scotch and poured myself another before my wife rejoined me
 have a drink i asked
 no thank you she snapped
 mad at me what do you think her tone was cool enough to freeze lava
 you have every right to be that answer i had found by experience was unanswerable
 what do you mean she asked in some bewilderment
 yes thanks i will have a drink after all
 you see winnie after we had talked it all over the other night after the bond rally dance and realized how we felt about it all the four of us decided to be well civilized about things
 and now i don t feel civilized about my wife i said pouring her a stiff one
 her eyes glittered and her cheek was tinged with color
 in spite of her anger she responded to the idea of male brutes contesting for her favor
 i didn t think you cared a damn she said at last and it s pretty late in the day to make a change now
 after all there is virginia
 that was the cue to clinch the situation
 to hell with virginia i announced
 i d rather live with you as your friend than sleep with la rutherford in ten thousand beds
 i can t help it i added boyishly
 she leaned forward and sniffed
 you have been drinking haven t you she remarked
 of course i have today in town i suddenly realized what a damn fool i d been to throw away something really fine for something very second rate
 so i drank
 too much
 and the more i drank the more i knew that i was right and that it was here where i belong with you
 if you don t want me to stay i ll go over to the country club for the night
 i ll even phone jerry rutherford for you him and his moustache but i m damned if i ll go running back to virginia
 she s not pukka how m i doing i added silently for the benefit of the master of ceremonies
 well she said after a long pause
 perhaps it s so mixed up perhaps you d better go to bed here and we can talk it over in the morning
 all of us
 i shook my head
 i don t want to hold any more mass meetings on the state of our mutual affections
 if you want that tenor tonsil snatcher you re welcome to him but i m damned if i ll be a good sport about it
 if you insist i ll buy you a divorce but i won t marry virginia that s final germaine s face relaxed
 she smiled
 we ll see how things look to you in the morning she said
 now was the time to play the trump card
 oh yes i said
 i brought home a present for you
 i walked over to the hanger in the corner and pulled the tiffany packages from my overcoat pocket
 here you are jimmie tompkins i said with all my alleged love
 alleged is right but she picked eagerly at the wrappings and swiftly ferreted out the diamond brooch
 why winnie it s lovely she began then whirled on me her eyes blazing
 is this a joke she demanded
 of course not what s the matter her laugh was wild
 oh nothing winnie
 nothing at all
 it s just that you should have decided to give me on her birthday a brooch with her initials in diamonds
 see them v
 so that s the catch i thought
 i should have guessed there would be something wrong with the set up and i kicked myself for not having bothered to trace out the monogram
 don t you see what i mean i grated or must i spell it out for you some time back when we were considering all this civilized swapping of husbands and wives i put in the order at tiffany s for virginia s birthday present
 today when i picked it up the clerk smirked at me he knows your initials don t begin with v and i suddenly knew i couldn t go ahead with the whole business
 so i brought the brooch back to you as a trophy if you want it
 you can do what you like about it
 it s yours
 you see jimmie i added that s the way things are
 i m burning all my bridges
 oh she said
 then after a long pause she added ah i don t think she remarked after another pause that i ll want to keep this and i m far too fond of virginia rutherford to humiliate her
 i think i ll just take this back to tiffany s and get something else
 so i had led trumps
 here s something else to be going on with i told her
 i got this for you anyhow win lose or draw and i produced the gold bracelet
 i thought it would go with that dress and your cameo and if you still want to wear it your wedding ring
 she cast quick glances from side to side like a bird that suspects a snare
 it s good she sighed
 winnie it s so good
 i guess
 there was a knock at the door
 it was myrtle mary
 will the master be staying for dinner mrs
 tompkins she asked
 of course i will mary i said
 is there enough to eat i ll see sir she replied in a manner which was practically an insult to us both
 and keep a civil tongue in your head i added
 she handed it back to me
 and keep your hands to yourself sir she said as she closed the door
 it was jimmie s hand restraining me as i started up
 let her go i said at last
 it s my fault i guess
 i haven t been happy and i did make a few passes
 from now on i ll try to be a bit more decent and livable
 god knows i have plenty to be ashamed of but nothing disgraceful 
 i hope
 so do i my wife began
 if you
 the telephone rang
 she picked up the receiver and listened for a moment frowning
 yes he s here she said passing me the instrument
 it s for you she observed
 it s virginia calling from new york and she sounds most annoyed
