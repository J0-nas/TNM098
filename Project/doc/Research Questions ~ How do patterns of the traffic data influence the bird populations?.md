### Research Questions ~ How do patterns of the traffic data influence the bird populations?



Each of the question may be applied to both the single as well as the multi day path partition of the data.

- What are the general traffic patterns?
- Do the patterns differ for specific cars?
- Do the patterns differ for some time intervals (mornings/evenings) or Days (specific weekend traffic)?
  - Day times
  - Days
  - Partition data -> build average or median -> compare each partition to it
- Are there any "illegal" (offroad) paths - next sensor data not connected by road
- If we find deviations, are they independent from each other? should the findings be used to further filter the data before searching for further features?
